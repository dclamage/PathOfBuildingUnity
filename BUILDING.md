# Building Path of Building Unity
Please note that this project is still in very early stages, so these instructions will change over time.

## Prerequisites
* Install [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
* Install [Unity 2020.1.6f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.1.6)
* Add a Unity license to Unity Hub. The free Personal license works fine.
* Path of Building Community Fork lua files must already be present in `C:\ProgramData\Path of Building` [This will change in the future once script downloading is implemented.]

## Clone the respository

```
git clone https://github.com/dclamage/PathOfBuildingUnity.git
```

## Set up the Unity Project
* Add the cloned directory as a project in Unity Hub
* Open the project
* Ensure the Unity Console is visible somewhere.
	* Use `Window->General->Console` or `Ctrl+Shift+C`

## Running
* Press the play button
* Right now, only console output can be observed as rendering is not supported yet.
